# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool that helps users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. This project provides a dynamic and educational experience for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning how sorting works.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Includes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Animations display the step-by-step process of sorting.
- **Customizable Speed:** Adjust the speed of visualization to observe sorting at different paces.
- **Array Customization:** Users can generate a random array or input their own values.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Core technologies for building the visualizer.
- **DOM Manipulation** – Used to create dynamic visual elements.

## Installation
